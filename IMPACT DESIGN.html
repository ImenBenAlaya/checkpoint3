<p>I’m going to be honest. For the past week, I’ve been racking my brain trying to think of a fun,<br> original 4th of July article for this year's festivities <br> but I've drawn a blank. Festivals and holidays are marketing gold, but as effective at driving sales and “delighting” customers as <br>they are, thinking of a campaign that is both unique and memorable isn’t easy <br> Continue ReadingIMPACT Blog Continue Reading</p>

<p>You know what I used to hate growing up? Summer Reading. Picking up a book just for fun<br> was and is great, but like most good things, once we were forced to do it, it lost all its charm.<br> I have to admit though, despite the annoyance and intrusion on our<br> summer relaxation, our teachers had good reason to assign what they did. We learned a lot (maybe with a little help<br> from Sparknotes) and sometimes they were even genuinely fun to read. So, listen up, class... <br> ---->Continue Reading</p>

        <p>USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN • CAREER <br><strong>Cool UX Careers You May Have Never Considered [Infographic]</strong></p>
<img src="img13.PNG">
<p> By: Kristin Linde June 30th, 2018</p>
<img src="img14.PNG">
<p>User Experience is one of my favorite things to talk about -- if that weren’t obvious enough to those of you who have seen me and Jessie-Lee Nichols tear apart the user-submitted<br> websites during IMPACTs Website Throwdown! Nothing excites me more than taking a deep<br> dive into the usability and functionality of a website and, with a background in graphic and <br>web design and years of experience as an inbound marketer, I have become quite good at <br>understanding UX and its importance in creating a successful marketing strategy. <br>---> Continue</p>

                 <p>If working in the agency world has taught me anything, its that you are going to be presented <<br>with some pretty challenging problems and you need to face them head-on.

           <p> I’ve always considered myself a generally happy person and, pun not intended, I’m glad.<br> We talk about this at IMPACT quite a bit; How a person’s mood can really affect the team around<br> them and we take it very seriously. If there’s something bothering you that’s work-related, <br>talk to the proper person. If it’s personal, work from home or take some time off.  Even with<br> this culture, I never considered the fact that you can actually measure someone’s overall<br> happiness.
